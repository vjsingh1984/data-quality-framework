## Security Considerations

This framework processes configuration files and executes data quality checks on Spark DataFrames. When deploying, consider:

- **Configuration sources**: Configs can be loaded from S3, HTTP, and local files. Ensure access controls are in place for remote config sources.
- **Dynamic engine loading**: Engines are loaded via `importlib` from the `dq.engine` package. Engine names are validated against an alphanumeric pattern.
- **SQL execution**: Table names from configuration are validated against an identifier pattern before use in Spark SQL.
- **Lambda evaluation**: The Deequ engine supports lambda assertions in config. These are parsed via `ast.parse` and restricted to lambda expressions only.
